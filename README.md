## The Project

AlphaOmega is a greek language learning project, designed for the study of New Testament Greek via the authentic texts and scriptures. Each word of the texts provided is clickable and opens a new tab with the respective entry of [perseus online dictionary](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=%CE%92%CE%99%CE%92%CE%9B%CE%9F%CE%A3&la=greek) for common words and the [bible names dictionary](https://biblicaltext.com/dictionary/%E1%BC%88%CE%B2%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%AC%CE%BC) for the names.

In this manner, whatever the form of a word present in the text may have, the student of greek will always have access to the dictionary form.

Additionaly, more dictionary entries will be available as the project evolves.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
