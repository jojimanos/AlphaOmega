[2] Therefore when you do merciful deeds, don't sound a trumpet before yourself, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may get glory from men. Most assuredly I tell you, they have received their reward. [3] But when you do merciful deeds, don't let your left hand know what your right hand does, [4] so that your merciful deeds may be in secret, then your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. [5] 'When you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Most assuredly, I tell you, they have received their reward. [6] But you, when you pray, enter into your inner chamber, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. [7] In praying, don't use vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking. [8] Therefore don't be like them, for your Father knows what things you need, before you ask him. [9] Pray like this: 'Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. [10] Let your kingdom come. Let your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth. [11] Give us today our daily bread. [12] Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors. [13] Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For yours is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever. Amen.' [14] 'For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. [15] But if you don't forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. [16] 'Moreover when you fast, don't be like the hypocrites, with sad faces. For they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Most assuredly I tell you, they have received their reward. [17] But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face; [18] so that you are not seen by men to be fasting, but by your Father who is in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you. [19] 'Don't lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal; [20] but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves don't break through and steal; [21] for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. [22] 'The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light. [23] But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness! [24] 'No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You can't serve both God and Mammon. [25] Therefore, I tell you, don't be anxious for your life: what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor yet for your body, what you will wear. Isn't life more than food, and the body more than clothing? [26] See the birds of the sky, that they don't sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns. Your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren't you of much more value than they? [27] 'Which of you, by being anxious, can add one cubit to the measure of his life? [28] Why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They don't toil, neither do they spin, [29] yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these. [30] But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, won't he much more clothe you, you of little faith? [31] 'Therefore don't be anxious, saying, 'What will we eat?', 'What will we drink?' or, 'With what will we be clothed?' [32] For the Gentiles seek after all these things, for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. [33] But seek first God's Kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well. [34] Therefore don't be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day's own evil is sufficient."

[4] Or how will you tell your brother, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye;' and behold, the beam is in your own eye? [5] You hypocrite! First remove the beam out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother's eye.

Do you gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles? [17] Even so, every good tree produces good fruit; but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit. [18] A good tree can't produce evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit. [19] Every tree that doesn't grow good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire. [20] Therefore, by their fruits you will know them. [21] Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. [22] Many will tell me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy in your name, in your name cast out demons, and in your name do many mighty works?' [23] Then I will tell them, 'I never knew you. Depart from me, you who work iniquity.' [24] 'Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house on a rock. [25] The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it didn't fall, for it was founded on the rock. [26] Everyone who hears these words of mine, and doesn't do them will be like a foolish man, who built his house on the sand. [27] The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell -- and great was its fall.'

[7] Jesus said to him, 'I will come and heal him.' [8] The centurion answered, 'Lord, I'm not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed. [9] For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.' [10] When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed, 'Most assuredly I tell you, I haven't found so great a faith, not even in Israel. [11] I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven, [12] but the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth.' [13] Jesus said to the centurion, 'Go your way. Let it be done for you as you as you have believed.' His servant was healed in that hour. [14] When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother lying sick with a fever. [15] He touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and served him. [16] When evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick; [17] that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: 'He took our infirmities, and bore our diseases.' [18] Now when Jesus saw great multitudes around him, he gave the order to depart to the other side. [19] A scribe came, and said to him, 'Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.' [20] Jesus said to him, 'The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.' [21] Another of his disciples said to him, 'Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.' [22] But Jesus said to him, 'Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.' [23] When he got into a boat, his disciples followed him. [24] Behold, a great tempest arose in the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves, but he was asleep. [25] They came to him, and woke him up, saying, 'Save us, Lord! We are dying!' [26] He said to them, 'Why are you fearful, oh you of little faith?' Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm. [27] The men marveled, saying, 'What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?' [28] When he came to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass by that way. [29] Behold, they cried out, saying, 'What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?' [30] Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them. [31] The demons begged him, saying, 'If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.' [32] He said to them, 'Go!' They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water. [33] Those who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons. [34] Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders."
